# [CISC 4080: Algorithms](http://www.dsm.fordham.edu/~eschomburg/algorithms/)

## HW7 Problem 5(d)
**Due Monday, December 11 by midnight**

Modify the code in [`hw7_linprog.py`](hw7_linprog) to have SciPy's linear
program solver, which uses the simplex algorithm, solve the advertising
campaign problem posed in the homework question. See the documentation here:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html.

If you do not have python installed on your machine, you can run this
